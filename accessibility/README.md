# Web Accessibility Learning Objectives

## ARIAâ€™s Main Purpose
Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) serves as an essential tool for enhancing the accessibility of dynamic web content and applications. By providing additional attributes and semantics to HTML elements, ARIA aims to improve the usability of web content for individuals who rely on assistive technologies.

## WCAG Conformance Levels (A, AA, and AAA)
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. These levels provide a framework for assessing and prioritizing accessibility improvements on websites and web applications. Level A addresses the most basic accessibility features, AA addresses a higher level of accessibility, and AAA addresses the highest level of accessibility.

## The Importance of Web Accessibility
Web accessibility is crucial for ensuring that digital content is usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities. It promotes inclusivity, enhances user experience, and allows businesses to reach a broader audience. Moreover, web accessibility is often mandated by laws and regulations in various jurisdictions.

## Tools to Use for Web Accessibility
Numerous tools are available to assist developers in ensuring web accessibility. These include automated testing tools like Axe, WAVE, and Lighthouse, which can identify common accessibility issues. Additionally, manual testing using assistive technologies such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, and voice recognition software is essential for verifying accessibility compliance. Training resources, guidelines, and checklists provided by organizations like W3C and A11Y Project further aid developers in implementing accessible design and development practices.
