# Learning Objectives for Sass and SCSS
This repository covers essential topics related to Sass and SCSS, providing a comprehensive guide for learners.

## 1. What Sass Means
Sass, or Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets, is a popular CSS preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It introduces features like variables, nested rules, and mixins, enhancing the capabilities of standard CSS.

## 2. How to Write Sass & SCSS Files
Learn the fundamentals of writing Sass and SCSS files, including the syntax, file structure, and conventions for organizing styles.
