# Bootstrap

## Usage of Containers
Bootstrap containers provide a simple and effective way to center your content and ensure proper padding and margins. They are used to wrap site contents and align them within a consistent layout.

- Example:
<div class="container">
  <!-- Your content goes here -->
</div>

## Usage of the Grid System
Bootstrap's grid system is a powerful tool for creating complex layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. It is based on a 12-column grid system that allows for easy organization of content.

To create a grid layout, use rows and columns:
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <!-- Content for the first column -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <!-- Content for the second column -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

# Usage of Components
Bootstrap comes with a variety of pre-styled components that you can easily drop into your project. These components include navigation bars, buttons, forms, cards, and more.

To use components, simply add the appropriate class to your HTML elements:
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
  <!-- Navigation content goes here -->
</nav>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary Button</button>

<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <!-- Card content goes here -->
</div>

#Usage of Utilities
Bootstrap provides a set of utility classes that allow you to quickly style elements without writing custom CSS. These classes can be used to apply margin, padding, text alignment, color, and more.

To use utilities, apply the desired class directly to your HTML elements:
<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">This is a primary colored box with padding</div>

<p class="text-center">This text is centered</p>
